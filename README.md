My progression as a developer
=============================
This git repository reflects my progression as a software
developer.


I was lucky to have alot of notes and data about all the projects
I've done so far and created a git commit for each relevant (or nostalgic)
event that has contributed to my personal progression as a software developer.

How to
======
Update the portfolio.yml according to the impact you think something
had on your developer career. If you want to create a commit in the past use
```bash
git commit -m "Did something noteworthy" --date="10.03.2009"
```
You might have to work alot with dates to create the correct history:
Alex Peattie has written a good [introduction](http://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git/) about how to work with git dates.
